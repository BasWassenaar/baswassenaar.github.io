# Using GitHub Pages now... So this post is obsolete. :-) 

I never had the need for my own "blog", because all the things I wanted to share workwise was Azure Stack Hub related. Thanks to Mark Scholman for letting me be a part of [AzureStack.blog](http://azurestack.blog). ;-)

But sometimes things happen and you need to adjust. My work with Azure Stack Hub came slowly to a halt and I also noticed that my interest went more towards software (and Azure) architecture in general. So I probably need a new blog to put my stuff that's not Azure Stack Hub related. 

Last year we did an [Azure Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqNFdUycrkc) online with [Chris Reddington](https://www.cloudwithchris.com/) about Azure Static Web Apps. This gave me the inspiration to try something different instead of a standard Wordpress site. I gave [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a try, together with Azure Static Web Apps and Github. Still learning, because I'm an IT Pro by heart, not a developer. But I like it, great way to hobby my way forward like I'm 16 years old again!

If I got something to share I will try do this here from now on.

All the best,

**Bastiaan**
