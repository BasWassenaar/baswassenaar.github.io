So I recently passed the [DP-900 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/dp-900/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700). For me as an IT Pro of 20 years now, this was doable without too much prep. But I passed nearly, so I guess I was a bit lucky too. 😉

Here are my tips for preparing for the exam.

## Step 1: Microsoft Learn self-paced training 👟
Take the [self-paced training](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/courses/dp-900t00?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700) on Microsoft Learn. This will get you up to speed with the basics of Azure Data Fundamentals. 

## Step 2: John Savill's DP-900 study cram v2.0 📼
[This video from John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gtpasITVnk) gave me a better insight in some of the concepts. John's way of explaining things really suits me.

## Step 3: Microsoft Learn resources 📚
The following resources are based on the things I needed to learn more about myself. Can be different from your shortlist. 😉
- [Cosmos DB General docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700) - To understand the different datamodels and their API's.
- Database solutions: [OLAP](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/online-analytical-processing?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700), [OLTP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/online-transaction-processing?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700) and [Data Lakes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/scenarios/data-lake?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700)
- [ETL/ELT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700)

## Step 4: Practice exam 📝
[Take the practice exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/dp-900/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=24&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700). This will give you a good idea of what to expect. You can check your answers right away to get instant feedback.


## Step 5: Exam ✍️
Good luck with the [DP-900 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/dp-900/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004700), don't stress about it. If it helps, I failed a good amount myself at the first try. Just try again and you'll get there. 👍
