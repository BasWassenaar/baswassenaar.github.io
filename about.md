Hi, and nice you're reading this. I use this place to put things that I think can be useful to others related to my work as IT Consultant. Things about Microsoft Azure, (software) architecture and things that help (or helped) me in my professional career. üöÄ

I'm an experienced IT infrastructure guy who focuses on Microsoft Azure and software architecture. Born and raised in The Netherlands, I now live in Norway and work as an independent consultant. I'm a a big supporter of the ‚Äúwork hard, play harder‚Äù movement (if there is one‚Ä¶) and enjoy exchanging knowledge and experiences with others.
