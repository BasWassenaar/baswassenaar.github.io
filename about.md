Hi, and nice you're reading this. I use this place to put things that I think can be useful to others. Mostly about things concerning my work-life. Things about Microsoft Azure, (software) architecture and things that help (or helped) me in my professional career.

I'm an experienced IT infrastructure guy who focuses on Microsoft Azure and software architecture. Born and raised in The Netherlands, I now live in Norway and work as an independent consultant. I'm a a big supporter of the “work hard, play harder” movement (if there is one…) and enjoy exchanging knowledge and experiences with others.
